* **mitmproxy** is a console tool that allows interactive examination and modification of HTTP traffic. It differs from mitmdump in that all flows are kept in memory, which means that itâ€™s intended for taking and manipulating small-ish samples.

* **mitmweb** is a web-based interface for mitmproxy.

* **mitmdump** is the command-line companion to mitmproxy. It provides tcpdump-like functionality to let you view, record, and programmatically transform HTTP traffic.
